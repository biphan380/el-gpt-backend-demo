The Human Rights Code is a statute in the Canadian province of
Ontario that guarantees equality before the law and prohibits
discrimination in specific social areas such as housing or
employment. The code's goal specifically prohibits discrimination
based on race, colour, gender identity or expression, sex, sexual
orientation, disability, creed, age and other grounds .[1] The code is
administered by the Ontario Human Rights Commission and
enforced by t he Human Rights Tribuna l of Ontario.
The Human Rights Code was the first law of its kind in Canada. It
replaced various laws that dealt with different kinds of
discrimination. The code brought  them together into one law and
added some new protections. The code came into force on June
15, 1962. June 15 was chosen as the proclamation date for the
code because it was the 747th anniversary of the signing of the
Magna Carta.
The code replaced the province's existing anti-discrimination
legislation, including:
Fair Employment Practices Act, 1951 which prohibited
discrimination based on race and religion in
employment;
Female Employee's Fair Remuneration Act, 1951 which
prohibited an employer from paying a female employee
less money for the same work done by a man in the
same establishment
Fair Accommodation Practices Act, 1954 which
prohibited discrimination in public places on racial,
religious or ethnic grounds;
Ontario Anti-Discrimination Commission Act, 1958 which created a commission to
administer the above acts and develop educational programs;
At the same time that the Ontario Human Rights Commission was created, the gove rnment of the day, led
by Premier Leslie Frost introduc ed an amendment to the Fair Accommodation Practices Act to prohibit
discrimination because of race, colour or creed in the renting of apartments in buildings which contain more
than six uni ts.History The Human Rights Commission led an extensive review of the Code in the mid-1970s , culminating in a
report titled Life Together: A Report on Human Rights in Ontario. Some of the report's recommendations
were adopted in the Ontario Human Rights Code, 1981 , which passed in December 1981.[2]
The code prohibits discrimination on the grounds  of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin,
citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, marital status, family status,
disability, the receipt of public assistance (housing only), record of offences (employment only), or by
association w ith a person identified by a ny of  those grounds .
The most recent amendment to this list was on June 19, 2012, to add gender identity and gender expression
to the list of prohibited grounds .
The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) is the administrative, quasi-judicial tribuna l tasked with
hearing complaints that the code has been violated. It has the power to grant damages and specific
performance to remedy discriminatory acts. The HRTO is subject to judicial review by the Divisional Court
of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.
Before June 30, 2008, human rights complaints were filed with the Ontario Human Rights Commission
(OHRC), which investigated claims of discrimination. Since June 30, 2008, claims of discrimination are
filed directly with the HRTO, leaving the OHRC to concentrate its resources on systemic discrimination,
public education and pol icy development.
The code is divided into an introduc tory section, or  "preamble", followed by s even parts.
Part I sets out basic rights and responsibilities.
Part II explains how the code is interpreted and applied.
Part III explains the role and structure of the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC).
Part IV explains the role and structure of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO).
Part IV.1 establishes the Human Rights Legal Support Centre (HRLSC) and sets out its
governance.
Part V deals with general matters such as the power to make regulations and sets out that
the Human Rights Code has primacy over other provincial legislation (section 47(2)).

Part VI of the code deals with the transition from the "old" system, where complaints were
investigated by the Ontario Human Rights Commission to the "new" system (which took
effect on June 30, 2008) where applications are now filed directly with the Human Rights
Tribunal of Ontario without any investigation.
The code does not apply to federally regulated activities, such as banking, intra-provincial transportation,
aeronautics and telecommunications, which are subject to the Canadi an Human Rights Act. According to
HRTO adjudicator, the Code only protects people with protected grounds  from not being discriminated.
The victim has the burden to prove the discrimination is due to his/her protected grounds . The HRTO statedGrounds
