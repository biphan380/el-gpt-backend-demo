 3 INTRODUCTION  
[1] This Application alleges discrimination with respect to  employment  because of 
race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, ethnic origin, family status, marital status and age 
contrary to the Human Rights Code , R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, as amended (the “ Code ”). 
Although all of the grounds enumerated above were identified in the original Application, 
at the hearing , the applicant, through counsel, focussed on race, colour, ethnic origin 
and age.   
[2] Specifically, t he applicant  asserts that she was not offered, or given the 
opportunity to compete for, a position that was given to a person who was  one of her 
direct reports , for reasons relating to the Code grounds identified. She asserts that she 
was, instead , left in the part of the company’s business that was being phased out.   
[3] The applicant  argues that this position was one that would have put her on a path 
to senior management within the r espondent organization and she was denied that 
opportunity because of Code  grounds . It was given, instead, to someone who was less 
experienced because the other candidate was younger and not a member of a 
racialized group . The applicant argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”.  
[4] The respondent denies discrimination, asserts that the applicant was a valued 
employee  who rose within the ranks of their organization rapidly and  argues that placing 
the applicant in the job in question would have amounted to a demotion  for the 
applicant , with a commensurate removal of management responsibilities and decreases 
in salary grade, amount and benefits .  
[5] The respondent  points out that the applicant did not approach any member of the 
senior management group about the job in question or indicate that she believed she 
had been discriminated against until her exit interview by which time she had already 
voluntarily  resigned her employment . The respondent  seeks dismissal of the 
Application.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 4 [6] This Application was heard over four days in February and May, 2014.  For the 
reasons that follow, this Application is dismissed.

THE FACTS  
[8] The applicant is a woman in her early forties of South Asian descent.  At the time 
of the hearing, she had ju st turned 42. She is married and the mother of a 5 -year-old 
daughter. She was born in Kuwait and raised  in the United States. She self-identifies as 
being Indian and describes  herself as racialized.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 5 [9] The applicant has a Bachelor’s  degree in Health Care Administration from Texas 
State University, from where she graduated in 1998. While employed by the 
respondent, she completed an industry -related course between August 2010 and 
December 2011 and received a certificate from IFEBP. She  also took an Excel 
workshop to improve her skills.  The courses completed while she was employed by the 
respondent were paid for by the respondent.  
[10] Prior to her joining the respondent company, she worked at the Ontario 
Pharmacy Association  (“OPA ”) from 200 6 to December 2009, as an insurance co -
ordinator , where she  managed claims . Prior to her tenure at the OPA, she worked at 
Inhealth solutions from 2004 to September 2005 as a client services associate and 
managed medical portions of automobile claims.  
[11] Prior  to these jobs, she worked in Dallas, Texas at Travellers, a property and 
casualty insurance company  from April 1999 through to August 2002. She initially 
worked as a worker ’s compensation claims m anager and then in the company’s 
subrogation  department .  
[12] The applicant describes the respondent business as one created by the Ontario 
Dental Association (the “ODA”) t o manage claims . The O DA is the only shareholder  of 
the company. It is housed in same building and share s office space .   
[13] The parties agree that the applicant was a good employee , received excellent 
performance reviews and rose within the ranks very quickly.    
[14] The applicant began working for the respondent company on April 5, 2010. At the 
time she was hired, she worked in a non -management role at a salary of $44,500.00. 
She was considered to be part of salary grade 7. She received a performance bonus of 
3.5% that year.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 6 [15] One year later, she was promoted to the manager level. Her salary increased by 
more than $10.000.00 to $57,500.0 0, and she went from salary grade 7 to 10. In 
January, 2012, she received another $1,000.00 raise.  
[16] As of June, 2012, she was manager of group administration and had seen a 
$23,000.00 increase in her salary and had moved up 5 grids on the salary scale in a 
two-year period. By that time, she was at salary grade 12  and earning $67,500.00 . 
[17] The parties spent some time during the hearing providing me with evidence 
about the racial composition of the workplace.  The applicant asserts that the executive 
management group is made up exclusively of non -racialized persons, while the 
composition of the administrative and clerical staff is more diverse and includes some 
racialized members.   
[18] The respondent indicates that the applicant was part of the management team 
and, as a result, there were racialized persons within the management structure of the 
company.  It also argues that the executive management group is diverse in ways not 
having to do with race but in respect of gender and sexual orientation. The respondent 
agreed that the staff is diverse and includes racialized persons.   
[19] At the time the applicant worked at the respondent company, it had two main 
lines of business ; public and private. The public side managed dental benefits for some 
public organizations such a s children’s aid societies and social assistance recipients . To 
use the language of the industry, it amounted to approximately 300,000 “lives” and 
constituted about 80% of the company’s business.  
[20] The other side of the business , the private side, involved a cting a s a third -party 
administrator for employers who funded their own benefits plans  health (vision, hospital, 
medical equipment, prescription) and dental. The company would create booklets, 
provide cards to employees, receive and pay claims. They would charge an 
admin istrative  fee for this service  and the client  would be billed monthly or quarterly.  
The private side represented 20% of the respondent’s business .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 7 [21] The applicant worked on the private side of the business. She testified that w hen 
she came on board, the private side was in a state of disarray. There had been a 
number of team lead s, customers had expressed dissatisfaction , and there had been 
instances of overpayments  or claims not being paid properly.   
[22] The p rivate side of the bu siness was not growing. Some groups were cancelling  
contracts  and the few coming on were smaller. The applicant testified that d uring a 
meeting with staff in the summer of 2012, Doug Cooper , the respondent’s CEO,  had 
indicated that the respondent would not be investing in the private side and would, 
instead, be focussing on the public side of the business.  
[23] The applicant testified that, as a result, she was looking for opportunities to work 
on the public side of th e business and learn more about it. She was interested in 
eventually moving into the senior or executive management group and knew that in 
order to do so, she would need to be come an integral  part of the public side of the 
company’s business.  Although she had made her interest in moving to the public side of 
the business  known , she had not been  given any opportunities to do so.   
[24] The applicant was caught by surprise  when , on December 6, 2012, she was told 
by the CEO, Doug Cooper, and Sandy Fick , a member of  the executive management 
team , that  “CQ” , a member of the team that reported to her , was being moved to  a 
newly created position  on the public side of the business . In her new role, CQ would be 
reporting directly to Sandy Fick.   
[25] The job had not been posted, an open competition had not been held and, in the 
applicant’ s opinion , there were several more qualified and experienced candidates for 
the job that could have been selected.  
[26] Although her team had been reduced by the departure of CQ, the applicant was 
told that the  position would not be refilled and the  workload would have to be 
redistributed between the remaining staff on the team .   
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 8 [27] The applicant believed that this signalled that CQ was being groomed for a 
position in the senior or executive managemen t group, something to which she aspired.  
She believed that she was being left in a part of the business that was dying out.  
[28] She did not raise her discrimination concerns during the meeting on December 6, 
2012. However, she did object to the fact that her t eam would now have to continue to 
operate with fewer resources . She  later sent an email seeking  additional pay for the 
team as a result of the higher workload; a request that was denied.  
[29] I heard a great deal of evidence about the applicant’s view that the process by 
which this job was created and filled was irregular and that while she considered CQ a 
good employee  and had provided her with positive performance reviews , she did not 
find her to be  an exceptional one . She also te stified that CQ’s qualifications and 
experience  were not so stellar that she was an obvious fit for the job. The applicant’s 
view was that o ther older and racialized employees had been overlooked by the 
respondent when filling the job without a competition , including  the applicant.   
[30] The applicant filed the instant Application to the Tribunal on December 10, 2012 , 
and resigned her employment on December 20, 2012 , as she felt she could not 
continue in her job with the respondent . The parties agree that d uring  her exit interview 
with Doug Cooper on January 4, 2013, the applicant  raised the issue of discrimination  
with the respondent for the first time . 
[31] The applicant says that during that meeting, when she raised the issue of 
discrimination and the improper transfer of CQ, she was told that the position was given 
to CQ because she was a good fit and had skill s, such as marketing,  that the applicant 
did not.   
[32] Doug Cooper’s version of what took place during that meeting differs. H e gave 
evidence that  when the appl icant resigned, he had assumed initially that she had found 
another job, perhaps with a competitor, and he was sorry to see her go. He says he 
knew that the applicant was upset that CQ had been transferred out of her department 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 9 because of her reaction duri ng the meeting of December 6, 2012, but that he was 
surprised when the applicant raised the issue of discrimination.   
[33] Doug Cooper says that the respondent valued the applicant’s contribution  and 
that she had been instrumental in sorting out issues in her department and then 
ensuring the continued smooth operation of the private side of the business.  
[34] He indicated that although the respondent was engaged in restructuring  
activities , any plans to divest itself of the private side of the business did not inclu de an 
intention to let the applicant go. He confirmed that the company’s plans for the applicant  
involved having her eventually move into the role of manager of operations but 
acknowledged that had not yet been communicated to her.    
[35] Doug Cooper  says that during his meetings with the applicant he had tried to 
explain to her that th e reason the position was created was that in November, 2012, a 
new software system had been purchased and Sandy Fick’s responsibilities were 
increasing as a result of this purcha se.  Sandy Fick  needed additional administrative 
assistance.  The job CQ was put into, according to him, was  an administrative role , with 
no management duties or responsibilities and compensated at a much lower level – 
salary grade 9.  He said that the execu tive management team had never considered 
demoting the applicant to take on that role.  
DECISION  
[36] This Application alleges an infringement of section 5 of the Code , which provides 
that every person has the right to equal treatment  with respect to employment without 
discrimination on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, 
citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, 
record of offences, marital status, family status or disability.  
[37] The appli cant has the onus of proving on a balance of probabilities that an 
infringement of the Code  has occurred.   A balance of probabilities means that it is more 
likely than not an infringement has occurred.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 10 [38] Discrimination is not defined in the Code , but has been the subject of much 
judicial consideration. In Andrew s v. Law  Society of British Columbia , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 
143, in discussing the meaning of discrimination under the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms,  the Supreme Court of Canada stated:  
…discri mination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or 
not but based on grounds relating to the personal characteristics of the 
individual or group which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, 
or disadvantages on such individual or gr oup not imposed on others, or 
which withholds or limits access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages 
available to other members of society. Distinctions based on personal 
characteristics attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association 
with a group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those 
based on an individual’s merits and capacities will rarely be so classified.  
[39] Subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada have gone on to say 
that discrimination under both th e Code  and the Charter  require the applicant to 
establish a distinction on a prohibited ground to a member of a protected group that 
creates a disadvantage by perpetuating disadvantage or prejudice, or by stereotyping.  
See: Law  v. Canada (Minister of Empl oyment and Immigration) , [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, R. 
v. Kapp , 2008 SCC 41, and Withler v. Canada (Attorney General) , 2011 SCC 12.  
[40] In order to establish that her right to equal treatment in respect of employment 
has been infringed by the respondent, the applicant must es tablish that she has been 
subjected to differential and disadvantageous treatment on the basis of a Code  ground 
or that a neutral rule or requirement has had a differential impact on her resulting in 
disadvantage as a result of her members hip in a group identified by a Code  ground.  
[41] The applicant argues that this is not a case of direct discrimination. Instead, she 
argues that this is a case of “systemic discrimination”  and has argued that the principles 
in the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. 
Simpson s-Sears , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, apply . 
[42] She says that the respondent company’s senior or executive management group 
is exclusively Cauca sian and there are no racialized persons within that group. She also 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 11 asserts that j obs involving administrative and support functions in the company were 
filled by r acialized  persons , such as the applicant.   
[43] She argues that the decision to create a positio n and fill it without competition 
with a younger white woman is evidence that the respondent seeks to perpetuate that 
state of inequality and that decision resulted in a disadvantage to her  on the basis of 
Code grounds . 
[44] The respondent disagrees and argues that the applicant was, herself, a member 
of the management team of the respondent business before she resigned and it is 
inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that the management team is exclusively Caucasian 
and non -racialized. It says that there is diversit y both within the broader company as 
well the executive management team.  
[45] The respondent also argues that its decision to create and fill a new position 
without an open competition within the workplace was not in contravention of its own 
policies as it is o pen to the company to promote staff without a competition  and points 
out that one of the applicant’s own promotions did not involve a competition .  
[46] In any event, the respondent argues that the position in question was an 
administrative one and not a stepping stone to a seat a t the executive management 
table, as the applicant has assumed . It argues that the position created was not a 
management position and placing the applicant in that position would have amounted to 
demoting her  because of the lower salary grade, lower compensation level, lesser 
vacation entitlement and removal of management  tasks and responsibilities . 
[47] I am not persuaded of the relevance of the current racial composition  of the 
executive management group within the responde nt company to the issue s at hand. 
Assuming , without finding , that the executive management team was made up of 
exclusively non -racialized persons, that finding would not, in and of itself, lead me to 
conclude that the rights of the individual applicant in this Applic ation were infringed as a 
result of the racial composition of the various job categories within the company.  
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 12 [48] The event that brought matters to a head for the applicant was the creation of a 
job and the appointment of CQ to that job by the executive managem ent group.  
[49] Indeed, before that event, it is undisputed that the applicant , a racialized person,  
had experienced a steady and rapid progression through the ranks of the respondent 
company, had not raised any issues regarding being overlooked for promotion and 
advancement , and had not identified any barriers being placed in her path  or 
opportunities to which she or other racialized employees had been denied access.   
[50] Again, assuming , without finding , that the new position was improperly filled, 
without posting it and holding an open competition, it is not disputed that the p osition 
was one that  was at salary grade 9 and compensated at a level lower than the 
applicant’s salary in Dece mber, 2012.    
[51] If the job was improperly filled and I was to accept that there was, as the 
applicant argues, a “preferential hiring” or promotion of CQ, it resulted in CQ filling a 
position that would have amounted to a demotion for the applicant.  
[52] In other words, if there w as a preferential hiring or promotion of CQ, and 
differential treatment or a differential impact based in part on Code  grounds  occurred , 
those disad vantaged by these events  would have been co -workers working in positions 
alongside CQ, not the applicant, who was her manager.  It would be those individuals 
who could suggest that they had a legitimate grievance about the events in question.  
[53] I am not persuaded by the applicant’s evidence or argument that there was any 
discernable disadvantage arising out of the hiring or promotion of CQ to the applicant. 
Any future possible disadvantage to the applicant or advantage to CQ from the latter 
being placed in t his job , envisioned by the applicant , is speculative  and remote.  
[54] The mere fact that another person in the respondent company is promoted into 
another position does not lead inevitably to the conclusion that the applicant is being 
2016 HRTO 107 (CanLII)  
 13 disadvantaged or harmed as a result , particularly if, as is the case here, the transfer 
would amount to a demotion .   
[55] Even if the applicant is correct in assuming that CQ was being groomed to move 
up in the company, it does not follow that the applicant was disadvantaged or that her 
history of advancement and promotion was going to be negatively  impacted  going 
forward , i.e. that she would no longer being considered or “groomed” for advancement 
in the respondent company .  That is a conclusion, based on an assumption made by the 
applicant, that I do not find supported by the evidence that I have he ard. 
[56] Finally, even if I were to accept that the applicant was disadvantaged by not 
being given an opportunity to compete for the position CQ was placed into, I find that 
the respondent has provided me with a non -discriminatory explanation , unconnected to 
any Code  grounds,  for its failure to consider the applicant for that job, specifically that it 
would have amounted to a demotion to consider or place her in the job and the 
respondent did not wish to demote the applicant.  
[57] As a result, I find that t he applic ant has not established  on a balance of 
probabilities that her right  to equal treatment in respect of employment under the Code  
has been infringed.  
[58] Accordingly, t he Application is dismissed.   
Dated at Toronto, this 22nd day of January, 2016 .

)2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) INTRODUCTION 
[1] This is the Decision with respect to an Application filed under s. 53(3) of the 
Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c.H-19, as amended (the “Code”).  The complaint 
which underlies the current Application was filed with the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission on July 11, 2005 and abandoned upon the filing of the present Application 
with the Tribunal on November 13, 2008. 
[2] A Case Resolution Conference (“CRC”) was held on June 4, 2009 in accordance 
with the expectation, expressed in theCodeand the Tribunal’s Rules, that section 53(3)
applications proceed in a highly expeditious manner.  I heard from the applicant, the 
respondent Michael Shaw, and the respondents’ witnesses Diane Noto, Bruce Finlay 
and Hanna Katz (by telephone). 
[3] The applicant, who self-identifies as African Canadian, alleges that the
respondent Michael Shaw, a police constable, discriminated against him on the basis of 
race and colour when he stopped and questioned the applicant on March 9, 2005.  The 
other named respondents are the Toronto Police Services Board (“TPSB”) and William 
Blair, Chief of Police. 
[4] I find that Michael Shaw did discriminate against the applicant on March 9, 2005 
in the provision of police services on the basis of colour, contrary to section 1 and 9 of 
the Code.  
[5] The parties agreed to bifurcate this proceeding. The issue of remedy and the
liability of the TPSB and William Blair will be heard on the next day of hearing. 
Chronology of Events 
[6] The following events are not in dispute, except where I specifically note, by using 
words such as alleged, or asserted, or otherwise indicate a contested point. 
[7] On March 9, 2005, the applicant in his capacity of a relief letter carrier employed by 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 2 Canada Post was delivering mail in the area of the Bridle Path, which is a well known
affluent neighbourhood in Toronto.  It was his second day delivering mail on that route. 
He was wearing the Canada Post coat, carrying a mail satchel, and delivering regular 
mail and flyers.  He did not stop at every house as there was no mail for some houses 
and other houses had a “no flyer” notation.   
[8] That day, Michael Shaw, a police constable who had served in the area for 
several years was training a new police constable, Diane Noto.  At the start of their shift 
they were given a Directed Patrol Assignment, recommending that they patrol the area 
where the applicant was delivering mail between 12 p.m. and 4.00 p.m.  The 
assignment details were that phone lines had been cut in the area by suspects 
described as Male, White and East European, who were using a vehicle.     
[9] Constable Shaw decided to patrol the identified area that morning, in accordance 
with the Directed Patrol Assignment.  As the police car turned from Farrington Drive 
onto Vernham Avenue, Constable Shaw allegedly immediately pointed out a figure at 
the other end of Vernham Avenue as engaged in potentially unusual activity, walking in 
the middle of the street and then crossing back and forth.  It was the applicant although 
at that distance Constables Shaw and Noto assert that they were unable to discern the
gender or the skin colour of the person.  As the applicant approached, they could 
discern that he was an African Canadian male, wearing a Canada Post jacket and 
carrying material in his hand.  Constable Shaw asserts that he realized that this was not 
the usual letter carrier and that he was not stopping to deliver mail at every house.  
[10] Constable Noto drove the police car at a slow pace along Vernham Avenue, 
keeping the applicant in view.  They followed him to the corner of Vernham Avenue and 
Vernham Court where the applicant went up to a house, knocked on the door, and 
spoke to the woman who answered.  They did not see him deliver anything, which they 
thought unusual.  Constable Shaw instructed Constable Noto to inquire of the resident 
why the applicant had knocked.  Constable Noto spoke to the resident, Hanna Katz, 
who advised that the applicant had stopped to advise her that he had misdelivered 
something.2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 3 [11] Constable Noto advised Constable Shaw of this information. Constable Shaw
found this suspicious.  Accordingly, they drove up Vernham Court and stopped the 
applicant. 
[12] They asked him for identification.  The applicant willingly and politely provided his 
driver’s licence and his Canada Post identification. Constable Noto returned to the
police vehicle and performed a check which revealed nothing.  Constable Noto advised 
of the results and after some conversation, the manner and content of which is 
disputed, the police entered their car and departed to continue patrolling the area. 
[13] Shortly after this, they encountered another letter carrier Bruce Finlay at a relay
box picking up mail and Constable Shaw recognized him as the regular carrier on a 
nearby route.  Constable Shaw asked Mr. Finlay about the letter carrier in the Vernham 
Avenue area.  Mr. Finlay stated that he was a male, White about 35 years of age.  
Constable Shaw inquired about other potential letter carriers in the area and Mr. Finlay 
stated that there was a temporary carrier, a “Black man”, in the area.  The police drove 
on.   
[14] The applicant subsequently hailed the police officers to inquire why they had 
stopped him.  A conversation ensued, the contents of which are disputed. 
[15] The applicant believed that the police officers’ decision to stop and question him 
was because of his skin colour and he testified that he was upset, dazed and in shock.  
While continuing on his route that day, he noted that a White male delivering water in 
the area was not questioned.  He stopped at three construction sites where there were 
White workers and asked them if any of them had been stopped by the police.  None of 
them had been.  This is not disputed by the respondents.  The applicant also met up 
with Mr. Finlay that morning and learned that the police had questioned him (Finlay) 
about the letter carriers in the area.
Analysis and Conclusions 
[16] The relevant principles that apply in cases where an allegation of racial 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 4 discrimination has been raised have been usefully summarized as follows:
(a) The prohibited ground or grounds of discrimination need not be the 
sole or the major factor leading to the discriminatory conduct; it is 
sufficient if they are a factor; 
(b) There is no need to establish an intention or motivation to 
discriminate; the focus of the enquiry is on the effect of the respondent's 
actions on the complainant; 
(c) The prohibited ground or grounds need not be the cause of the 
respondent's discriminatory conduct; it is sufficient if they are a factor or 
operative element; 
(d) There need be no direct evidence of discrimination; discrimination 
will more often be proven by circumstantial evidence and inference; and 
(e) Racial stereotyping will usually be the result of subtle unconscious 
beliefs, biases and prejudices. 
Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. (No. 3) (2005), 52 
C.H.R.R. D/430, 2005 BCHRT 302 at para. 482; Pritchard v. Ziedler (2007), 
CHRR Doc. 07-527 (Sask. H.R.T.). 
[17] In this case, as in many cases alleging racial discrimination, there is no direct 
evidence that race was a factor in the officer’s decision to take the actions that he did.  
As a result, the issue of whether the officer’s actions amount to racial discrimination in 
violation of the Codefalls to be determined in accordance with the following well-
established principles applicable to circumstantial evidence cases. 
1) Once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established, the 
burden shifts to the respondent to provide a rational explanation which is 
not discriminatory. 
2) It is not sufficient to rebut an inference of discrimination that the 
respondent is able to suggest just any rational alternative explanation. The 
respondent must offer an explanation which is credible on all the
evidence. 
3) A complainant is not required to establish that the respondent’s
actions lead to no other conclusion but that discrimination was the basis 
for the decision at issue in a given case. 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 5 4) There is no requirement that the respondents' conduct, to be found
discriminatory, must be consistent with the allegation of discrimination and 
inconsistent with any other rational explanation. 
5) The ultimate issue is whether an inference of discrimination is more 
probable from the evidence than the actual explanations offered by the 
respondent. 
[18] In determining whether the inference of racial discrimination is more probable 
than the explanations offered by the respondent officer, I also need to be mindful of the 
nature of racial discrimination as it is understood today and that it will often be the 
product of learned attitudes and biases and often operates on an unconscious level: 
Nassiah v. Peel (Regional Municipality) Services Board,2007 HRTO 14 (CanLII).
[19] Courts in Canada have accepted that racial profiling by police occurs in Canada 
and have indicated their willingness to scrutinize seemingly “neutral” police behaviour to 
assess whether it falls within the phenomenon of racial profiling.  In R. v. Brown (2003) 
64 O.R. (3) 161 (Ont. CA) at para. 9, Morden J. A. stated that the Crown’s concession
that the phenomenon of racial profiling existed was “a responsible position to take 
because…this conclusion is supported by significant social science research”.  InPeart 
v. Peel Regional Police Service Board, [2206] O.J. NO. 4456 (Ont CA), Doherty J.A. 
stated the “racial profiling occurs and is a day-to-day reality in the lives of those 
minorities affected by it.” 
[20] There is no dispute that Constable Shaw, the senior police constable, directed 
the day’s events.  The issue for me to determine is whether the applicant’s skin colour 
was a factor in Constable Shaw’s surveillance of, decision to stop, and subsequent 
inquiry about the applicant.   
[21] Constables Shaw and Noto testified that the applicant’s skin colour was not a 
factor in their actions and was not discussed between them.  I accept their evidence that 
the applicant’s skin colour was not discussed between them.  However, I find that on a 
balance of probabilities, the fact that the applicant was an African Canadian in an 
affluent neighbourhood was a factor, a significant factor, and probably the predominant 
factor, whether consciously or unconsciously, in Constable Shaw’s actions.  2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 6 [22] Constable Shaw testified that a number of unusual features, including the
applicant’s behaviour, influenced his actions.  The features he asserted were unusual 
are these: the applicant was not the usual letter carrier, the applicant was crossing back 
and forth across the street, and the applicant did not stop at every house.  These three 
factors caused Constable Shaw to survey the applicant.  His suspicion was further 
fostered by the applicant’s knocking on the door of a house but not delivering any mail 
augmented by the excuse, as reported by the resident, that he had misdelivered some 
material.  However, after conducting a police check and asking the applicant some 
questions, Constable Shaw testified that he was completely satisfied that the applicant
was a legitimate letter carrier.  Constable Shaw testified that his further inquiries of 
Mr. Finlay at the relay box about letter carriers in the area was in the nature of a training 
exercise for Constable Noto to teach her that there were various ways to obtain 
confirming information. 
[23] In my view, the above chronology, as described by the respondent Shaw is more 
consistent with a finding that the applicant’s skin colour played a role in his actions than 
the applicant’s alleged unusual activity. 
[24] First, the fact that the applicant was not the usual letter White male letter carrier
is surely not a suspicious circumstance.  Letter carriers take vacation, retire, and/or 
switch routes, so the fact that another letter carrier was delivering the mail on that 
particular day cannot explain Constable Shaw’s heightened alertness.  I find significant 
that he did not respond in a similar way to an unfamiliar White male delivering water in 
the area. 
[25] Second, Constable Noto testified that immediately upon turning onto Vernham 
Avenue, Constable Shaw pointed out the applicant as a person of note.  It is not likely 
that Constable Shaw had already noticed the applicant’s alleged crossing back and 
forth across the street in an unusual manner as soon as they turned the corner.  
Whether or not Constables Shaw and Noto noticed a figure in the distance when they 
turned onto Vernham Avenue, I do not accept their evidence that the figure was 
crossing back and forth across the street in an unusual manner.2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 7 [26] Third, it is not in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that the
applicant was constantly crossing back and forth across the street. The applicant could 
not recall whether or how often he crossed the street that day.  However, he testified 
and his evidence is in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that while letter 
carriers usually deliver their mail on one side of the street and then the other, if they 
make a mistake in preparing their mail they might cross the street mid-street, 
occasionally.  Since there is no dispute that the applicant was, in fact, a legitimate letter 
carrier, either he made an unusual number of mistakes and crossed the street an 
extraordinary number of times on that day, or in the usual manner of letter carriers, he
may have crossed the street once or at most twice.  I do not accept Constable Shaw’s 
evidence as in keeping with the preponderance of probabilities that the applicant was 
crossing the street back and forth in an unusual fashion. 
[27] Fourth, Constable Shaw in his original response to the complaint, his will say
statement and his evidence at the hearing, noted the fact that the applicant did not stop 
at every house as an unusual circumstance.  However, the evidence of the applicant 
and Mr. Finlay was that it is not unusual for a letter carrier to skip houses if there is no 
mail to be delivered and the householder has asked not to have flyers delivered.  
Indeed, Constable Shaw conceded in cross examination by the applicant that he had in 
the past seen letter carriers skip houses.  In my view, it is in keeping with the 
preponderance of probabilities that Constable Shaw was well aware that letter carriers 
do not stop at every house.
[28] Accordingly, I conclude that it was not unusual behaviour on the applicant’s part 
that caused Constable Shaw to decide to place the applicant under surveillance but 
rather the fact that he was an African Canadian male in an affluent neighbourhood.  His 
suspicions were not alleviated by the Canada Post uniform, mailbag or mail delivery. It
is also noteworthy that the Directed Patrol Assignment related to suspicious persons in 
the neighbourhood with entirely different characteristics: White, Eastern European, 
using a vehicle. The fact that it was an African Canadian male without a vehicle that 
attracted Constable Shaw’s attention is what is unusual.  I am further reinforced in my
conclusions by Constable Shaw’s continued actions, described below.  2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 8 [29] Having decided to scrutinize the applicant, Constable Shaw found it suspicious
that the applicant knocked on a resident’s door and spoke to a woman but did not 
deliver any mail or flyers.  Mr. Finlay testified that it was not unusual to misdeliver mail 
and to go back and try to retrieve it, which is what the applicant did that day. 
Nonetheless, Constable Shaw found this to be suspicious behaviour and asked 
Constable Noto to ask the resident what the applicant had been doing.  Constable Noto 
testified Ms. Katz advised her that the applicant said he had misdelivered something.  
[30] Ms. Katz testified that she could barely recall the events of that day. However, 
she did call Canada Post that day to report the events and she agreed that the Canada 
Post report was likely accurate and that she was the only source of information on the 
Canada Post report.  Her report to Canada Post was that she told the police that the 
applicant had come to retrieve misdelivered mail.  Had Constable Noto inquired, she 
would undoubtedly have learned that Ms. Katz had in fact received misdelivered mail
the previous day, that she had delivered it to the correct address, and that she had told 
the applicant that.  Constable Noto apparently did not learn this as she immediately 
returned to Constable Shaw with the information that the applicant had said he knocked 
on the door to inquire about a misdelivery.  Constable Shaw concluded that this was 
suspicious behaviour, as it was not unknown for criminals to disguise themselves with 
legitimate uniforms and check out houses with false explanations.  In my view, but for 
Constable Shaw’s improperly heightened suspicion of the applicant, he would not have 
found the applicant’s alleged misdelivery suspicious.
[31] Accordingly, I conclude that the applicant’s colour was a factor in Constable 
Shaw’s continued suspicion of the applicant and his decision to stop and question the 
applicant.  
[32] After being provided with the applicant’s driver’s license and Canada Post 
identification and having ascertained that the applicant had no police record or other 
suspicious notations on his record, Constable Shaw nonetheless proceeded to question 
another letter carrier, Mr. Finlay, about the letter carriers in the neighbourhood.  Only 
after Mr. Finlay identified a "Black man” who was acting as a temporary letter carrier did2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 9 Constable Shaw cease his inquiries. I reject Constable Shaw’s explanation that he was
trying to teach Constable Noto about alternative ways to complete an investigation and 
find instead that Constable Shaw’s heightened scrutiny of the applicant was continuing. 
[33] I emphasize that although I have rejected each of Constable Shaw’s explanations 
as not consistent with the preponderance of probabilities, the combination of his actions
when viewed together further supports my conclusions.  
[34] I conclude that the applicant’s colour was a factor in Constable Shaw’s 
surveillance, decision to stop, and subsequent inquiries about the applicant on March 9, 
2005 and that he breached the applicant’s right to equal treatment without
discrimination on the basis of colour with respect to services, contrary to sections 1 and 
9 of the Code.
[35] I stated earlier that there were disputes between the parties with respect to the 
manner and content of the two conversations between the applicant and the officers. I
find that it is necessary to make some findings on these matters as they may affect the 
remedial aspect of the case.  The applicant asserted that the officers drove abruptly into 
a driveway that he was about to cross and approached him in an intimidating manner. 
The first word Constable Shaw uttered, in a disrespectful manner, was “ID.”  When he 
asked why they wanted his identification, Constable Shaw answered in an insulting 
manner, “I would ask even if you were the Prime Minister of Canada.” The police check 
took a considerable period of time during which the applicant asked to continue 
delivering mail and the police car followed him while he was doing so.
[36] This is denied by the officers.  They testified that they stopped on the curb and 
did not pull into the driveway because of rules against entering unnecessarily upon 
private property.  They politely advised the applicant that they were investigating break 
and enters in the area and asked for identification. While Constable Noto conducted the
police check, Constable Shaw inquired why the applicant had not delivered pamphlets 
to every home.  Upon being advised by the applicant that not everyone wanted 
pamphlets, and upon receiving the negative results from the police check, Constable 2009 HRTO 877 (CanLII) 10 Shaw apologized for stopping him. They deny following him in the police car while they
did the check.  
[37] I accept the applicant’s evidence that he felt intimidated by being approached by 
two police officers, wearing guns, one of whom, Constable Shaw, is a very large man.  I 
note that the applicant has a small stature. I also accept that he perceived that the
officers did not treat him respectfully.  However, I am not persuaded on a balance of 
probabilities that Constable Shaw used the police vehicle in an intimidating manner, that 
he approached the applicant in an intimidating manner or that he spoke rudely to the 
applicant.  
[38] The applicant did not give any detailed testimony about the second meeting after 
he hailed the officers and asked why they had stopped him, and therefore it is 
unnecessary to make any findings of fact about the manner in which he was treated at 
that time.   
[39] This hearing shall resume on September 14, 2009 to hear the evidence and 
argument with respect to remedy and liability of William Blair and the TPSB.  
Dated at Toronto, this 18thday of June, 2009.
